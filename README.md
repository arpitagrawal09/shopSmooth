shopSmooth
Ecommerce web app(MERN stack) portfolio project by Team Codemongers 

Welcome to shopSmooth, a feature-rich and easy-to-use Ecommerce application built using the powerful MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, Redux and NodeJS). Our goal is to provide a seamless shopping experience for our customers.
Our application is built using MongoDB as the primary database, which allows for efficient data storage and retrieval. ExpressJS is used to handle routing and API calls, while ReactJS and Redux are used for the frontend, providing a responsive and dynamic user interface. NodeJS is used for the backend, allowing for fast and efficient server-side processing.
shopSmooth is designed to be user-friendly, with a clean and intuitive interface that makes it easy to browse and search for products. Our easy-to-use shopping cart and checkout process ensure a smooth and seamless experience for our customers.
Additionally, our application is built with scalability in mind and can handle a large number of products and a high volume of traffic. We've also implemented security measures to protect our customers' personal information and ensure a safe shopping experience.
We are constantly working to improve shopSmooth and add new features, so stay tuned for updates and improvements. Thank you for choosing shopSmooth for your online shopping needs.
